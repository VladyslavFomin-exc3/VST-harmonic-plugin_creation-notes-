# VST Harmonic Plugin – Educational Project

This repository contains a simplified DSP core of a VST audio plugin developed
as part of a bachelor's project and quality assurance laboratory works.

## Purpose
The project demonstrates:
- basic audio signal processing logic (harmonic distortion, EQ concepts)
- unit testing of DSP-related functions
- traceability between functional requirements and tests

## Structure
src/ – core DSP logic
tests/ – unit tests for audio processing functions

## Notes
This repository is intended for educational purposes only.
The code does not represent a complete VST plugin implementation.
