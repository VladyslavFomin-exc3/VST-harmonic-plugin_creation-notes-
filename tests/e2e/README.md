# E2E Smoke tests (BDD / Gherkin)

This folder contains Cucumber-style BDD smoke scenarios for the VST Harmonic EQ Plugin.

- Format: Gherkin (Given–When–Then)
- Scope: E2E smoke scenarios for key functional requirements (R1.1, R1.2, R1.3)

Step implementations can be added later when DAW automation harness is available.
